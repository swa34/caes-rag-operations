# Backend Code Recommendations

This document contains recommendations for improving the backend codebase based on documentation analysis.

## Issue 1: Duplicate Cache Check ⚠️

### Problem

The response cache is checked in **two locations**, creating unnecessary overhead:

1. **Early check (correct)**: `src/server.js:238-336`
   - Checks cache BEFORE reframing, clarification, and RAG retrieval
   - Returns cached response immediately if found
   - This is the **optimal location** ✅

2. **Duplicate check (unnecessary)**: `src/rag/vector-ops/retrieve.js:235-251`
   - Checks cache INSIDE `retrieveRelevantChunks()`
   - Only runs if early cache missed
   - Adds unnecessary Redis round-trip time
   - Creates confusion about responsibility ❌

### Recommendation

**Remove the cache check from `retrieve.js` (lines 232-251)**

The early cache check in server.js is sufficient and more efficient.

### Benefits of Removal

- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary Redis round-trip (~5-20ms saved)
- **Clarity**: Single responsibility - server.js handles caching, retrieve.js handles retrieval
- **Maintainability**: Cache logic in one place reduces bugs
