# CAES RAG Operations - Feature Documentation

This repository contains interactive documentation for the CAES Intranet Help Bot RAG system, showcasing verified features and optimizations extracted from code analysis.

## 🎉 Latest Update: October 12, 2025
**Documentation Updated:** Added comprehensive architecture documentation including early cache check, clarification mode, date-based prioritization, streaming support, and GPT-5 API integration. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete system architecture.

### Previous Update: October 10, 2025
**Major Performance Breakthrough:** Achieved **89% response time reduction** (16.9s → 1.8s) through Redis caching implementation! See [REDIS_PERFORMANCE_UPDATE.md](./REDIS_PERFORMANCE_UPDATE.md) for details.

## 📋 What's Documented

### Verified Features (30+)
- **🚀 Early Cache Check**: Checks cache BEFORE reframing/RAG for 97% faster responses on cache hits
- **🤔 Clarification Mode**: Detects ambiguous queries and asks for clarification instead of guessing
- **5-Stage Intelligent Retrieval Pipeline**: Acronym expansion → Metadata filtering → Vector search → Feedback learning → LLM re-ranking
- **📅 Date-Based Content Prioritization**: Prioritizes recent content when similarity scores are close
- **PostgreSQL-Backed Conversation Memory**: Persistent sessions with 30-min TTL and automatic cleanup
- **Intelligent Question Reframing**: Context-aware follow-up question handling
- **📡 Streaming Response Support**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progressive response rendering
- **Feedback Learning System**: User feedback improves rankings over time (±10% score adjustment)
- **LLM Re-ranking with GPT-5-nano**: Smart semantic reordering (20-30% of queries)
- **Acronym Expansion**: 210 UGA-specific acronyms, zero-latency lookup
- **Metadata Filtering**: Query-aware category detection
- **Response Caching with Quality Control**: Caches successful responses for 30 days
- **Authenticated Crawlers**: 8 specialized crawlers for intranet sites
- And 18 more features...

### Performance Optimizations (18+) - **Updated Oct 12, 2025**
- **🔥 Early cache check** (Checks cache BEFORE reframing - 97% faster on hits)
- **🔥 Redis + PostgreSQL dual caching** (89% response time reduction - 16.9s → 1.8s!)
- **🚀 GPT-5 Responses API** (Generation with gpt-5-mini, re-ranking with gpt-5-nano)
- **📡 Streaming responses** (Progressive rendering for better perceived performance)
- **📅 Date-based prioritization** (Recent content boosting when scores are similar)
- **🤔 Clarification mode** (Prevents bad answers from ambiguous queries)
- In-memory acronym cache (0-2ms overhead)
- Smart LLM re-ranking triggers (70-80% cost savings)
- Metadata filtering at DB level (15-25% precision boost)
- Intelligent chunking (30% vector reduction)
- Question reframing heuristics (60% LLM call reduction)
- PostgreSQL session storage (multi-instance ready)
- Pinecone pre-initialization at startup
- Response quality control before caching
- Graceful fallbacks throughout
- And 3 more optimizations...
